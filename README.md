# Rock Paper Scissors

A small web project containing three easy to make recipes with an overview of the general process, the ingredients required, and the step by step process to make the dish.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

In this project, I utilize basic features in html such as headings, lists and unordered lists, links, and images. I also made sure to get used to using conventional organizational and naming practices in html, and also got some practice navigating through directories and folders. I also touch in foundational CSS, practicing organization and formatting through classes, ids, and the cascade.

## Optimizations/Other

One thing that I noted while building my web project was formatting for readability; I added some line breaks to make the web page look more organized and kept the design 

All in all, this was a fun introductory project and I look forward to seeing what other cool things I can build using html, css, and other languages in web development!
